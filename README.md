# Initial release of my personal dotfiles

- ~~**There's an install scripts but it isn't really complete yet, I won't take responsibility if your system is bricked**~~ **The install script is broken and I'm lazy to fix**
- The config is still very basic so it lacks a lot of features
- Assuming that you have all the packages listed here, the config should be working:
```
rofi-wayland walker swww waybar cava libcava kitty nautilus hyprshot zenity hyprlock nerd-fonts fastfetch
```

- This config is made especially for 1080p display so you should change the config according to your display and your need
- _Also this is my first time using github_
